deppa (出っ歯), jap. "bucktooth"#
is a server implementation of the gopher protocol.
it is very lightweight and can handle a lot of traffic on low-end hardware.

it converts markdown files in a directory to gopher responses on-the-fly.

.md will be served as directory listings, .txt will be served as plaintext (NOTE: please use DOS line endings, deppa will not convert anything!).
trailing slash is interpreted as directory listing and generated on-the-fly (or index.ext, if present).
gobj files should be executable, if they are, they will be executed and their output will be sent to the client (use format "text file" because deppa will not add any types to the output. if your program does tho, you can use any type you want to)
gm files are just plain old gophermap files.
other extensions will be piped to the sender but without a ".\r\n" at the end, so use it for binary files (or just put the dot at the end yourself :) )

links and images must be on single lines or else they will be ignored and sent as plain text.

magic strings follow the file system hierachy, leading slash is ignored and use of .. sends an error.
magic files: .reverse will reverse your directory listings, index.extension will replace any directory listings, .header will be sent before any content in this directory, .footer will be sent after any content in the directory
.header and .footer must be in plain text format
